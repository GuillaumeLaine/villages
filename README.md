## Some thoughts about the models

1. Make sure artifacts dont appear => planes not too close to each other
2. Make sure special textures are replaced by regular ones
3. Prerender shadows to textures (!)




## Install & Run

Starter template with a simple three.js scene setup using svelte and typescript

1. ``npm install``
